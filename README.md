# String Exercises

The String class in Java is a fundamental and widely used class that represents a sequence of characters. It is part of the java.lang package and is considered immutable, meaning once a String object is created, its value cannot be changed. 

The String class in Java is a fundamental building block for handling textual data, offering a balance between simplicity and functionality. Its immutability, integration with the standard library, and various methods for string manipulation contribute to its significance in Java programming.

Build UnitTest and classes/methods to complete the following task.

## 1. What is the length of this text?

```String word = “WeCanCodeIt”;```

## 2. Convert the variable word to all Upper case

```String word = “WeCanCodeIt”;```

## 3. Convert the variable word to all lower case

```String word = “WeCanCodeIt”;```

## 4. What index is “Code” located in?

```String word = “WeCanCodeIt”;```

## 5. Trim the following word to print out “WeCanCodeIt"

```String word = “           WeCanCodeIt”;```

## 6. Use the substring method to display the last letter of “WeCanCodeIt"

```String word = “WeCanCodeIt”;```

## 7. Use the substring method to display the first letter of “WeCanCodeIt”

```String word = “WeCanCodeIt”;```

## 8. Replace the first occurrence of  “aa” with “bb” from the following variable

```String word = “aaccaa”;```

## 9. Use the method contains() to check if the following variable contains “Code”

```String word = “WeCanCodeIt”;```

## 10. Reverse a String

Write a Java function to reverse a given string without using the `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` classes.

## 11. Duplicate Characters

Write a program to find and print the duplicate characters in a given string.

## 12. Count Vowels and Consonants

Create a Java program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.

## 13. Palindrome Check

Implement a function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backward).

## 14. String Compression

Write a function to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3".

## 15. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## 16. Substring with Concatenation of All Words

Write a function to find all the starting indices of substring(s) in a given string that is a concatenation of each word from a given list.

## 17. Rotate String

Implement a function to rotate the characters of a string to the right by a given number of positions.

## 18. String to Integer (atoi)

Implement the `atoi` function, which converts a string to an integer.
